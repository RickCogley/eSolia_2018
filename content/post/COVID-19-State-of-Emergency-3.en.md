The state of emergency was declared again in Tokyo and its neighboring three prefectures at midnight on 8th January.
This document will explain eSolia’s system.

This time, it is focused more on restaurant businesses, however, the continued vital messages are “social distancing” and “to avoid the 3Cs (Crowded places, Close-contact settings and Closed spaces)”. Please take thorough preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 based on   <a href="https://corona.go.jp/prevention/pdf/atarashii_seikatsu.pdf" target="_blank">“New lifestyle”</a>and<a href="https://www.fukushihoken.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/iryo/kansen/kannsenyobouhandbook.files/tominmukehandbook.pdf" target="_blank">“COVID-19 Infection Prevention Handbook for the General Public”</a> (17th December 2020) <a href="https://www.hosp.tohoku-mpu.ac.jp/data/covid/COVID_handbook_ver02-2_en_20200424.pdf" target="_blank">English</a> issued by the government.
We ask you to adhere strictly to the following regarding eSolia’s system and when visiting a client onsite.

  &#42; ：While responding to client’s requests, please try to ask for their understanding of utilizing more remote support and adopting staggered visiting hours to prevent infection.<br>
  <br><br>

<li><b>Code of conduct for onsite visit</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Take body temperature and check your health condition every morning. If you feel unwell, avoid visiting clients onsite.</li>
      <li><font color="red">Please observe each client’s guidelines for infection prevention measures. Each individual may feel differently towards infection prevention measures and COVID-19. As a member of ITMS, be aware of what you say and do. As a member of eSolia, please keep your behavior consistent with the company’s policy of infection prevention measures. 
      (For example, you should avoid talking to clients about private conduct (behavior that is deemed socially unacceptable = taking trips or going out while being requested to refrain from making unnecessary journeys)).</font></li>
      <li>Be sure to follow the other precautions required by clients at their location. Even if you have different personal views on those precautions, act appropriately as a member of eSolia and follow the client’s views.</li>
      <li>Keep social distancing at the client’s site: when working onsite, make sure to keep physical distance between the accompanying engineers and the EU.</li>
      <li>Wear a mask (carry a spare mask). *eSolia will send masks to the site with the client’s permission for use at the IT desk.</li>
      <li>Wash hands (carry sanitizing hand wipes and disinfectant spray). *eSolia will send antiseptic solution to the site with the client’s permission for use at the IT desk.</li>
      <li>Practice proper cough etiquette.</li>
      <li>Limit the number of visitors to client: up to two people.</li>
      <li>Ventilate the work area frequently (check with the person in charge at the client’s site).</li>
      <li>When visiting a client all day or when you are required to take a break during the visit, avoid having a break together with colleagues. Take turns to take a meal or break as much as possible.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Daily life</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Refrain from going out after 8pm unless absolutely necessary, and avoid the 3Cs. When leaving the house for a valid reason, such as to go shopping or to seek medical assistance, you are required to keep it short.</li>
      <li>Please take proper measures against infection in both public and private, such as refraining from having meals or drinks with people other than your family members.</li>
      <li>Dinners among employees are also prohibited for the duration of the state of emergency.</li>
    </ul>

<li><b>Contacting the office</b></li><br>
  In the unlikely event that any of the following cases apply, the company is obliged to inform the relevant parties (health center, clients and so on). Please contact us immediately.
    <ol>
      <li>When you suspect you have been infected</li>
      <li>When you become infected</li>
      <li>When you have been in close contact with person/s who are infected</li>
      <li>When your family member becomes infected</li>
    </ol>
  In all of the above cases, it is a major premise that you follow the instructions of the local health center. To establish contacts between the employees and at a client’s site, we will check the history of your work status, last attendance at work, persons who came in contact with you and so on. We thank you for your cooperation.<br><br>

    * Family doctor: if your family doctor is registered outside the jurisdiction of your place of residence, please note that you could be referred back to a health center within your jurisdiction, since a doctor may prioritize the patients living within the jurisdiction. If you have a family doctor, we recommend that you check with them in advance.
    <li>2.	If you do not have a family doctor, call Tokyo Fever Outpatient Center &lt;open 24 hours (including Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays)&gt;</li>

    <li>For those who have mild symptoms only and are treated at a designated accommodation facility or at home, the case will be treated in accordance with the above. A course of medical treatment will end at the discretion of the health center, and the restrictions on employment shall be lifted.</li>
    <li>The date to return to work is finalized after confirming with the employee’s family doctor or industrial physician. Depending on the progress of treatment, you may be asked to monitor the progress for a certain period of time (during which you are to work from home or stay at home etc).</li>

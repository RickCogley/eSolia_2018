## The History

eSolia has used various systems to generate and publish our websites over the years. We've used several standalone website "builder" apps that you run on a local PC or Mac, such as Microsoft's FrontPage, IBM Home Page Builder, Macromedia DreamWeaver and Realmac RapidWeaver. And we've used a couple of server-side CMS systems as well: WordPress, Drupal, Typo3.

However, when a site does not _need_ to be driven by a database, then a class of site known as a "static" site should be more than sufficient. Static websites are comprised simply of html, css, javascript and multi-media files. Many developers author these sites manually, and copy them up to a web server via FTP or SSH for serving.

## Benefits of Static

eSolia has many web pages, but, none of them really _require_ us to use a CMS. If a site has no need for transactions in a database to be driving the content visitors see in a dynamic manner, then why add the overhead of a CMS? We decided to put weight on the superior security and performance of a static site.

A simple comparison between static sites and CMSs is as follows:

_Aspect_  |Static    | CMS
----------|----------|------
_Performance_    |Best       |Lower
_Security_       |Highest    |Lower
_Infrastructure_       |Simpler    |More Complex
_Backup_     |Easy     |More Difficult
_Data Driven_  |No     |Yes
_Content Update_  |Via Files    |Access Dashboard
_Visual Style_   |Any    |Themes
_Upgrades_    |As You Like   |Continual & Fragile

## The Trouble with Static

These days, open source "static site generators" (SSGs) are all the rage, and use some kind of application you install on your Mac or PC to weave together html template files, content files usually written in markdown, css files for style, javascript scripts for UI tricks, and your media files like photos and videos. The problem with SSGs is that you have to install some programming language like Perl, Ruby or Python on your system, to get them working.

Most SSGs therefore come with the overhead of maintaining a development environment for a required programming language, and all its myriad dependencies. What that really means is the environment has to be _kept_ updated, and that trouble will likely occur when you upgrade or patch the OS. Sometimes, this can get really difficult and irritating. Your site then cannot be updated until you get everything installed just right.

Another problem with SSGs is build performance. It may take a fair amount of time to generate the site, because SSGs generally have to iterate through all your files and build each page, every time you update.

## Enter Hugo

</figure>

We did a lot of searching for an SSG which would be easy to use, and fast when building the site. [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), written in the modern "Go" language, fits that requirement perfectly. It is not only available as a single, easy-to-install binary file for Mac, Linux and Windows, it was built by [Steve Francia](http://spf13.com) ([@spf13](https://github.com/spf13)) and [contributors](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/graphs/contributors) to be insanely great in terms of speed and performance.

As a result, most Hugo sites build in milliseconds; in fact it usually takes longer to sync them to your web host (via rsync or ftp) than it does to generate the site files!

Hugo is distributed as a single executable binary file, which you can easily install on Windows, Mac or Linux. There _are_ no dependencies, since it's just the one file, that contains everything you need.

## Using Hugo

To use Hugo, a web designer builds html "template" files that reference css and javascript, as well as various variables that Hugo understands (like the title, description or keywords of the page). Content files are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text format. The designer then simply runs Hugo to merge folders of content text files, into the HTML templates, CSS and Javascript files. The result, in a few milliseconds, is a fully-built website folder that can be transferred to a web host.

## Hugo for eSolia Sites

When we tested various SSGs, we liked Hugo's ease-of-use and excellent performance so much that we decided to re-build a few of our sites using it. So far we have built our main [English](http://esolia.com) and [Japanese](http://esolia.co.jp) sites, as well as the site your are looking at, our [eSolia.pro](http://esolia.pro) blog site.

Hugo's open source [community](http://discuss.gohugo.io/latest) is vibrant, [development](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) is actively proceeding, and we'd love to welcome new users to the fold. Please join in!

Or, if you're considering Hugo as a solution for re-doing your own website, please feel free to [contact eSolia](http://esolia.com/info-request).

## Thank you

eSolia turns 19 this 7th July 2017, and we'd like to extend a big thank you for your continual support and patronage since we founded eSolia in 1999. 

As a leading bilingual IT management provider in Japan, we strive to grow the foundations that support your business, and help you to succeed.

Over the past year, we focused on 

* Restructuring middle mgt
* New website with ERP integration
* Tuned project management
* Building web business
* Building technical capability


LAST TIME - building our staff and restructuring our operations to what we find is a better model. It has been a successful year, adding staff and running projects large and small, while providing the usual on-going support. eSolia has one mandate: your challenges and requirements, so do lean on us for your project and IT needs in Japan.

_Thank you once again_ for helping us reach our 19th anniversary in business; we are aiming for another decade of success with you, our supporters.

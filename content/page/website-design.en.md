## Your Website Design is Integral to Your Business

**_Or, at least it should be._** When you launch a website, it should actively market to help your business grow, and not just act as a static brochure. The benefits of a well-designed website are enormous, but the primary goal of a site launch is to make a fantastic first impression immediately to visitors, with the perfect tone. Your corporate vision should be built directly in to how the site is designed and assembled, and be apparent to a visitor right away, either directly or subconsciously.

#### On Static versus CMS

eSolia can deploy a static site, like the one you are looking at now, or a CMS-based site such as Wordpress or Typo3. Some of the considerations regarding static websites vs CMS-hosted ones are shown in the following table:

_Aspect_  |Static    | CMS
----------|----------|------
_Performance_    |Best       |Lower
_Security_       |Highest    |Lower
_Infrastructure_       |Simpler    |More Complex
_Backup_     |Easy     |More Difficult
_Data Driven_  |No     |Yes
_Content Update_  |Via Files    |Access Dashboard
_Visual Style_   |Any    |Themes
_Upgrades_    |As You Like   |Continual & Fragile

We discuss this topic at the beginning of any from-scratch project.

## Why should you outsource?

One of the primary benefits is service continuity - hired or contracted individuals may be very good, but individuals move on, taking your system knowledge with them.

eSolia's support and engineering team "teamITMS" is focused on providing you with best practices for consistent quality engineering and support - leaving you more time to focus on your business.

### Outsourcing Benefits

* **Service continuity** - full ongoing maintenance of the outsourced operation's agreed service level.
* **Access to eSolia teamITMS** - experienced expert professionals with a wide range of skills.
* **Latest knowledge** - teamITMS experience works for you in a way that you would not get by hiring an individual.
* **Focus** - eSolia outsourcing allows decision-makers to concentrate on their business.
* **TCO Reduction** - total cost of ownership is reduced when you outsource your IT operations.

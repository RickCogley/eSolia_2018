The following is a list of emergency and useful numbers for visitors and residents of Japan. A few things to note: 

* In the case of a disaster such as an earthquake, people proceed to designated disaster areas. Check with your friends, colleagues or the hotel regarding where you should go, and go with the flow. 
* The "NHK World TV" app on iOS and Android can receive alerts from the "[J-ALERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-Alert)" emergency broadcast system. eSolia recommends visitors and residents to install this app from your app store, and in its notification settings, set it to receive quake, tsunami and/or breaking news alerts. 
* Public phones, although a bit anachronistic as of today, can connect you with emergency services for free. Steps: 
  1. Pick up the receiver
  1. (On a Green Phone only, press the red button near the base of the phone. Grey phones don't have this button.)
  1. Dial 110 for Police or 119 for Ambulance or Fire
* Some office phones cannot dial emergency numbers like 110 or 119, especially modern "IP Phone" systems. If you're in an office, ask your colleagues. 
* Japan has a famous system of "koban" police boxes across Japan. You can ask for directions or get help in emergencies.

See our list of useful apps below. Japan has the "[J-ALERT](/japan-emergency-broadcast-system-j-alert/)" emergency broadcast system, and some apps such as the "NHK World TV" can receive the alerts in a timely way. 

eSolia recommends visitors and residents to install these apps from your app store, and confirm settings to receive quake, tsunami and/or breaking news alerts.

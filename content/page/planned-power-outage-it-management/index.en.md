## A Regulatory Requirement

Japan fire code requires buildings over a certain size to be inspected annually, and this always includes a power cycle requirement. Usually, power goes down sometime on Friday night or Saturday, and is restored on Sunday. It's a kind of "necessary evil" that IT then has to get involved to make sure systems are properly shut down, then powered up and tested after the outage. 

### eSolia is Here to Help

There's no need to try to do it yourself. Leave it to eSolia to handle the IT systems shut down, power up and operational validation that is needed in these cases. We'll handle it in an organized manner, and you get a detailed report about what happened at the end.

If one uses IT efficiently, one can utilize the basic nature of IT freely, and leverage that to receive immeasurable benefits. However, if misunderstood, IT can be a double-edged sword, increasing work and even decreasing efficiency.

To use it effectively, there's no need to try to handle everything internally. In fact, say goodbye to fear of processes, and leave your process management to eSolia!

### The eSolia Philosophy for Process Management

Each process is different, but in all cases, eSolia performs in a consistent manner:

* We act as an ombudsman on your behalf, keeping your mandate or the best practice in mind, as we negotiate with any involved parties.
* Each process is performed with supporting documentation as the base, whether that documentation is your standards and mandates, or our best practices.
* You give the "go sign", but our experts provide the decision support.
* We'll take end to end responsibility. All processes will have preparation, adjustment, execution, documentation and support afterwards.
* Results are stored in eSolia's extensive knowledge database, and reports are provided to you.

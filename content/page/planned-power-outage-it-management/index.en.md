## A Regulatory Requirement

Japan fire code requires buildings over a certain size to be inspected annually, and this always includes a power cycle requirement. Typically, power goes down sometime on Friday night or Saturday morning, and is restored on Sunday. It's a kind of "necessary evil" that IT has to get involved in [the process](/process) to make sure systems are properly shut down, then powered up and tested after the outage. 

### What Happens During

We have found while stewarding so many of these power outages, that there are invariably problems in 90% of cases. Some piece of equipment breaks or starts giving errors. It's a good exercise, in that you would rather have the break occur while you're watching it, but it's frustrating nonetheless. If we are there helping, we can also deal with the issues. 

Time is usually tight, but we often take the opportunity to execute a change request. It could be removing old equipment or cable from the rack, or mounting new equipment. Or taking the opportunity to upgrade device firmware. If it is something that takes time, we'll usually do it on the evening before. 

Once the power is restored and your systems are successfully powered on, testing and validation has to be performed. It's often done partially by us, and partially by a user of the client. We can assist your users to help them test and document the results. 

Speaking of documentation, we take the opportunity every year to make sure documentation is updated. 

In the end, we write a report about everything that happened and what we observed, then submit that to local stakeholders as needed, and overseas IT management.

eSolia consulting is all about leveraging professional expertise to skillfully define problems, pinpoint client capacities and weaknesses apolitically, create practical and reasonable action plans, and have an influential involvement in their implementations. The results of any consulting process should be real improvements - not just the latest fad or program.

We have confidence that our team of experienced professionals with a wide-range of experience in IT and business, will do just that. The real improvements we catalyze, help us earn a lasting rapport with our customers, based on mutual trust.

## 5 Steps to Success

Here are more details for the five steps that must be completed in any successful consulting engagement -

### Agreement:

The first step in the consulting process allows us to come to a clear understanding with the client as to what each party wishes to achieve, and how they are going to approach the engagement, working up an equitable engagement agreement document to act as a touch-point throughout the engagement.

### Discovery:

Discovery is the bulk of the consulting engagement, where the key dialogue occurs that allows us to act as a catalyst to convince our clients to take action. Here, we identify the problem clearly focussing on both the presenting and root challenges, select problem dimensions to study, pick engagement team members, decide data collection methods, and then collect, filter and summarize the data. Finally, an analysis of the data is performed to prepare for the next step.

### Feedback:

Feedback is the step in which we take the results of the Discovery process, and assertively feed back our recommendations to our client. Here, we create a focused feedback report from our findings, condensing them into relevant actions against challenges our client can control. Our primary goal in Feedback is to work with our client to come to a decision about which actions to take.

### Implementation:

The Implementation step is where we assist our clients in implementing the plans everyone has had a hand in creating. eSolia professionals recognize that this process is not just technical step-by-step execution, but also requires acknowledgement of relationship and commitment changes during the process. To this end, we attempt to create an atmosphere of trust where team members can express their opinions or reservations fully, and in which listening and presenting occur in equal measure.

### Recycle:

The final step is to perform a "post-mortem" on the engagement to decide if there is anything else that needs solved, whether to extend, recycle or terminate. At this stage, we feel a certain success if our client can solve related problems independently, the next time around.

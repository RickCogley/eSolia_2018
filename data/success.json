    "Project Background": "Management determined that a lab is needed in Japan, and this project entails building an office and lab, and moving two offices into 1,231 m<sup>2</sup> (13250 ft<sup>2</sup>) of leased space. Electron Microscopes are extremely sensitive instruments which need a tightly controlled environment, so the construction of the lab area had to be completed to a very strict specification. ",

    "Problem": "* sensitive lab instruments need a tightly-controlled environment, with regard to vibration and humidity.\r\n* lab engineers require data for temp, humidity and oxygen.\r\n* delivery of heavy lab equipment requires reinforced floor.\r\n* lab floor must be anti-static and anti-chemical in certain areas. \r\n* water is being piped to the tools, so there is a risk of damage from flooding. ",
    "Problem‡": "* これ\r\n* それ",
    "Solution": "* tight control of building location selection, and strict specification of HVAC environment control\r\n* devices deployed to measure temp, humidity and oxygen, and data stored in eSolia cloud db \"[PROdb](https://esolia.com/prodb)\".\r\n* floor reinforced by steel plates to allow delivery of heavy lab equipment. \r\n* special anti-static, anti-chemical flooring poured over slab. \r\n* a water \"rope\" is in use to shut off water flow if flooding is detected.",
    "Solution‡": "* これ\r\n* それ",
    "Benefits": "* final lab area is a true showcase and designed specifically to supply the environment that the electron microscopes need.\r\n* environment data is available to lab engineers, and a report is sent automatically on a regular basis. \r\n* damage is limited by auto-shutoff of water pipes, when flooding is detected. ",
    "Benefits‡": "* これ\r\n* それ",
    "Technology": "* special HVAC units installed to control humidity.\r\n* Chemicrete liquid flooring.\r\n* sensors that collect data on temp, humidity, water leakage and oxygen level.",

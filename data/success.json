    "Project Background": "Management determined that a lab is needed in Japan, and this project entails building an office and lab, and moving two offices into 1,231 m<sup>2</sup> (13250 ft<sup>2</sup>) of leased space. Electron Microscopes are extremely sensitive instruments which need a tightly controlled environment, so the construction of the lab area needed to be completed to a very strict specification. Client was acquired partway through this project, which caused a few new challenges along the way. ",

    "Problem": "* Sensitive lab instruments need a tightly-controlled environment, with regard to vibration, sound absorption, EMI, temperature and humidity among others.\r\n* Lab engineers require data for temp, humidity and oxygen.\r\n* Delivery of heavy lab equipment requires reinforced floor.\r\n* Lab floor must be anti-static and anti-chemical in certain areas. \r\n* Water is being piped to the tools, so there is a risk of damage from flooding. \r\n* IT cabling is physically a challenge in the lab, because of the special construction. \r\n* New but ill-defined IT standards need to be followed. \r\n* Client standard Honeywell door security system must be connected with Panasonic building management system. ",
    "Problem‡": "* これ\r\n* それ",
    "Solution": "* Tight control of building location selection to reduce vibration, strict specification of HVAC environment control in and design of lab rooms.\r\n* Devices deployed to measure temp, humidity and oxygen, and data stored in eSolia cloud db \"[PROdb](https://esolia.com/prodb)\".\r\n* Floor reinforced by steel plates to allow delivery of heavy lab equipment. \r\n* Special anti-static, anti-chemical flooring poured over slab. \r\n* A water \"rope\" is in use to shut off water flow if flooding is detected.\r\n* New IT equipment selected to conform to future standards. \r\n* Engineering performed to link Honeywell door security system to Panasonic building system; designed, installed, tested, operational guidelines created. ",
    "Solution‡": "* これ\r\n* それ",
    "Benefits": "* Final lab area is a true showcase and designed specifically to supply the environment that the electron microscopes need.\r\n* Environment data is available to lab engineers, with periodical reports sent automatically. \r\n* Damage is limited by auto-shutoff of water pipes, when flooding is detected. \r\n* IT environment is modern and flexible. \r\n* Global standard Honeywell security system is enabled, yet still linked to domestic building security system and fire alarm. ",
    "Benefits‡": "* これ\r\n* それ",
    "Technology": "* Special HVAC units installed to control humidity.\r\n* EMI control equipment installed in lab rooms with most sensitive equipment. \r\n* \"Chemicrete\" liquid flooring used to reduce static and allow chemical spills.\r\n* Sensors that collect data on temp, humidity, water leakage and oxygen level.\r\n* Cisco network and telecomm equipment. \r\n* Honeywell door access system, with custom link to Panasonic building security system.
